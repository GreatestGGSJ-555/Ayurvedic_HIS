# ðŸš€ Git Repository Guidelines

Welcome to our Git repository! This document outlines the best practices for contributing to this project. Please follow these guidelines to maintain a clean and organized repository.

## ðŸŒŸ Do's

### 1. Create an Issue First

Before making any code changes, create a GitHub issue to discuss the problem or feature you plan to address. This ensures clear communication and helps in tracking progress.

### 2. Create Feature or Bugfix Branches

For each issue or task, create a dedicated branch from the `main` branch. Use descriptive branch names like `feature/new-feature` or `bugfix/issue-description`.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
```

### 3. Keep Commits Atomic

Make commits small and focused on a single task. Each commit should address one issue or feature. Use descriptive commit messages that start with a verb.

```bash
git commit -m "âœ¨ Add user registration functionality"
```

### 4. Pull from `main` Frequently

Regularly pull the latest changes from the `main` branch into your feature branch to avoid conflicts and stay up-to-date with the project's progress.

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 5. Use Feature Branches for Pull Requests

Submit pull requests (PRs) from your feature branches to the `main` branch. PRs undergo code reviews before merging.

### 6. Write Tests

For new features and bug fixes, write unit tests whenever applicable. Ensure that existing tests pass before committing.

### 7. Document Code Changes

Update code comments and documentation to reflect changes. This helps maintain code readability and makes it easier for others to understand your code.

## ðŸš« Don'ts

### 1. Don't Commit Directly to `main`

Avoid committing directly to the `main` branch. Use feature branches and submit PRs for code review.

### 2. Don't Push Sensitive Information

Never push sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or secrets to the repository. Use environment variables or configuration files for such information.

### 3. Don't Skip Code Reviews

Always seek code reviews from team members before merging a PR. This ensures code quality and consistency.

### 4. Don't Merge Your Own PRs

To maintain code quality and transparency, don't merge your own PRs. Another team member should review and merge them.

### 5. Don't Forget to Pull Before Pushing

Before pushing your changes, always pull the latest changes from the `main` branch to avoid conflicts.
